# 🏥 Insurance Claims Optimization (AI/ML)

## Project Overview
This project leverages **machine learning** to predict whether an **insurance claim will be approved or denied**.  
The goal is to assist insurance companies in optimizing decision-making, reduce manual errors, and improve efficiency in processing claims.  

The system is implemented with **Streamlit** for the user interface and Python-based ML models for predictions.

## ✨ Features
- Streamlit-based simple and intuitive web interface.  
- Claim approval prediction based on customer and claim details.  
- Synthetic dataset generator for testing.  
- Trained ML model stored for reusability.  
- Option to analyze approval trends by age and claim amount.  
- Student-friendly UI with sleek fonts, colors, and layout.  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend/UI**: Streamlit  
- **Backend/Model**: Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy)  
- **Language**: Python 3.9+  
- **Dependencies**: Streamlit, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib (for analysis)  
- **Deployment**: Local machine (extendable to Cloud/Docker)

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Input**: User provides claim details (age, claim amount, etc.).  
2. **Processing**: Data is preprocessed and fed into a trained ML model.  
3. **Prediction**: Model outputs whether the claim will be approved or denied.  
4. **Output**: The result is displayed in the Streamlit app.  
5. **Analysis**: Users can view claim approval patterns by age group.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/insurance-claims-optimization.git
   cd insurance-claims-optimization
Create and activate a virtual environment:

python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
source .venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
Generate sample dataset (optional):

python generate_sample_data.py
Train the model:


python train.py
Run the Streamlit app:

streamlit run app.py
📊 Dataset
The dataset includes:

Age – Age of insured person

ClaimAmount – Amount requested by the policyholder

ApprovedAmount – Amount approved by insurance company

Other Features (region, gender, etc. depending on dataset)

You can place your dataset in the data/ folder (default: data/claims.csv).

🗺 Roadmap
Add fraud detection alongside claim approval prediction.

Provide visual dashboards (approval rate by age, region, claim size).

Deploy the app on Heroku/Render/Cloud.

Support real-time data input from forms instead of CSV upload.
